# ENCoRP
A Tool to Compute and Visualize an <b>E</b>lectrical <b>N</b>etwork's <b>Co</b>nductive and <b>R</b>adiative <b>P</b>ropagation

ENCoRP is a tool with which a user can build a single- or three-phase network composed of transmitters, cables, junction boxes, loads, and receivers. Once a network has been constructed, ENCoRP predicts and visualizes the conductive and radiative propagation in the form of spatially resolved voltages and currents, point-to-point transmission parameters, and the electric and magnetic fields.
